> The game **Flappy Space** is a simple clone of a famous Flappy Birds iconic game made with a little twist, by adding math problems in a space environment so the player can sharp his brain while soothing with relaxing music and ambient sounds. Made a first project and left as is in order to show the progress of Unity and C# projects.

## Features
- **Version**: Unity 2020.3 (LTS)
- **Tags**: Platformer, 2D, Math
